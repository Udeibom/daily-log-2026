##The Beginning 
#Today is the first of January and I'm laying out my plans for the year.
#Top of that list is making at least a commit per day on GitHub round the year.
#There's been no electricity and I am still laying out what I have for the year.
#This is a testament of my commitment 
#At the end of the year, you will realize my growth by first checking the commit message, that's where it starts.
